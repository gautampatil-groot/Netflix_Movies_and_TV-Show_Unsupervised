# **Project Summary -**

**Unsupervised learning is used in this data science project to analyze a dataset of 10,000+ Netflix films that includes information on the titles, release year, genre, director, cast, and rating. Data cleaning and visualization using tools like scatter plots and histograms are the first steps in the process. Similar titles are grouped using clustering techniques like k-means and hierarchical clustering after preprocessing processes like scaling and dividing into training and testing sets. Through the use of measurements like the elbow technique, optimal cluster numbers are identified. Data structures are easier to visualize when using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE. Meaningful clusters are found using evaluation criteria like the WCSS and silhouette score. In the end, these data help Netflix make better recommendations and improve the viewing experience.**

# **Problem Statement**


**This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service's number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.**
